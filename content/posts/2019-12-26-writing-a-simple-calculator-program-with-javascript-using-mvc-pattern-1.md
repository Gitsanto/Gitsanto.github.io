# What I want to do?

I want to write simple calculator app with plain JavaScript using Model-View-Controller design pattern.

Check out [Demo](https://gitsanto.github.io/SimpleCalculator_UsingMVCDesignPattern/)

# Process

Creating 3 files only

* index.html : It consists of a single root element only in the body tag.
* style.css : It has styling for calculator.
* script.js : It consists of model, view and controller classes.

## What the heck is design pattern?

In programming world, programmers talk about things like singletons, mvc instead of basic terms like int, arrays. 

I not big fan of this but you will see many different design pattern used in software applications.

In definition [Design pattern   Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern)

A design pattern is the re-usable form of a solution to a design problem.

## What is MVC?

MVC(Model View Controller) is one of the popular design pattern.

* model :  applicationâ€™s data objects are stored
* view : User Interface
* controller: decision maker which is linked between model and view, such as clicking



# Conclusion

Hope it helps you to understand MVC. Happy Coding
